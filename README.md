Emotion Recognition on a CK+ dataset.

Genetic Algorithm has been used as the local search algorithm for feature subset selection.

Hyperparameters:

    Selection : Roulette, Rank based, Steady State
    
    Crossover: Single point, k = {2,4,6} point, Uniform Crossover
    
    Mutation: Bit Flip, Bit Swap(swap 2 random positions)
